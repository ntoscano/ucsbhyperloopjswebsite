    description: "Separable, decoupled differential equations which describe gravitational, electromagnetic, and scalar perturbations of nonrotating (Schwarzschild) and rotating (Kerr) black holes have recently become available. Fortuitously, many interesting astrophysical processes near black holes can accurately be studied with these perturbation equations. A number of such processes are here investigated (as well as some matters of principle in pure relativity): vibration of black holes, and the long wave-trains of gravitational waves which such vibrations may generate; the spectrum and intensity of gravitational radiation from a particle falling radially into a Schwarzschild hole; the physical significance of the Newman-Penrose conserved quantities, the result that they are never physically measurable and do not always exist; the time evolution of a rotating black hole immersed in a static scalar field, a quantitative calculation of the hole's spin-down and alignment; scalar-field calculations of superradiant wave scattering from a rotating black hole, and of the possibility of floating orbits; these are both wave processes which extract a hole's rotational energy"
